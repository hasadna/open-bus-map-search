# Running the Project

For start working on the project you can use any of options from the below:

- You can set up project locally. This is **highly recommended** for regular/repeat contributions. This setup allows you to work and test your changes.
- Use Gitpod, a free online dev environment. Clicking the link below will start a ready-to-code dev environment in your browser. It only takes a few minutes.

Click [here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus-map-search) to
open project in Gitpod

# Running the project on a local environment
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   Before you clone the repository to your local machine, you need to create a fork of it on GitHub. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project. To fork the repository, click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   After forking, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<Your GitHub Username>/open-bus-map-search.git
   ```

   Make sure to replace <Your GitHub Username> with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory by running:

   ```bash
   cd open-bus-map-search
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   The project uses npm to manage dependencies. Once Node is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. **Run the Project:**
   After all dependencies are installed, you can start the project by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The project should now be running on your local machine. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.

# How to open the PR

- If you're new to GitHub, here is a [tutorial describing Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
- create a branch
- branch better to be named after issue (or feature) it tries so solve, e.g. `feat/add-close-button-to-modal`
- Please make sure that the project works on your computer
- do changes and then - do commit (`git commit -m "feat: add some feature"`)
- push the branch to remote repo (`git push`)
- go to the original repo and create a pr (by pressing `create a pr` button)
- tag one of the maintainers as reviewers

# Commit message convention

- commit messages better to be short and explain clearly what the change is about
- `fix` change that tries to fix some bug, e.g. `fix: make close button visible at mobile`
- `feat` change that add some new functionality, e.g. `feat: add a modal component`
- `docs` change that adds some documentation, e.g. `docs: add project description at readme`
- `reafctor` change that makes the code better, e.g. `reafctor: split App component to subcomponents`
- `chore` all the other things `chore: upgrade react package to new 18 version`

## FAQ

### Why do I get a red `x` commit status?

- lint - you have lint errors. fix them by running `npm run lint:fix`
- tests - you have test errors. see them by running `npm run test:unit:ci`
- build - you have build errors. see them by running `npm run build`
- pr title validation - you have an invalid pr title. please edit the title of your PR with conventional commit formatting. examples: `feat: add new feature`, `fix: fix a bug` or `docs: update README.md`
