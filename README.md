# Easter eggs
We've hidden a couple of fun surprises in our web app, just for you. Discovering them is as easy as typing a few magic words on your keyboard.

## How to Find the Easter Eggs
1. Open our [web app](https://open-bus-map-search.hasadna.org.il/dashboard)
2. **Unleash the Magic Words:**
   To reveal the hidden gems, use your keyboard to type the following commands:

   - **Type "storybook":**
     Watch the magic unfold as you type "storybook" on your keyboard. You might just stumble upon our Storybook, a treasure trove of UI components showcasing the beauty and functionality of our app.
   - **Type "english":**
     Feel like switching up the language? Type "english" and see the language toggle in action. Our app is multilingual, and you can experience it by triggering this secret command.
   - **Type "geek":**
     To get some experimental charts with some additional data and aggregation
