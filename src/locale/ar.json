# MOT Complaint Maker

## NOTICE

this project is still under development - it won't really send any reports to the MOT website.

## Goal

After searching for specific bus in one of the pages, users might wasnt to submit a complaint about a bus:

- maybe the bus came too early / too late
- maybe it didn't stop at all
- maybe the bus driver had a yellow T-shirt
  and so on.

anyway - we would like to make complaints submission accessible and easy, instead of the dark UX we currently have.

## usefull commands

build the image - `npm run docker:build`
run the image (won't really send anything to the MOT) - `npm run docker:run`
see the report - `npm run view-trace`
